# Rocket Landing Simulation

## What the simulation does

Engineers use computer simulation to test ideas before investing in expensive machinery or exposing people to dangerous situations. NASA relies heavily on simulation in their space program, including simulating vehicle landings on the moon. 

In this simulation, The user controls a lunar lander ship as it descends towards the moon's surface. Gravity causes your ship to accelerate towards the surface, and the user must use a single control labeled "thrust" to slow it down. The objective is to land the ship safely on the moon by controlling the speed of descent with the thrust button. However, there is a limited amount of fuel available, and using too much fuel too early will cause the ship to crash.
